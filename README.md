# MoMath Hackathon 2017: Travelling Salesman

## The Math

The travelling salesman problem is a famous NP-hard computational problem, where you must find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a complete weighted graph and which gains computation time quickly as the number of cities increases.

## The Submission

Our submission is a simple version of this problem, allowing users to attempt to find the shortest route by stepping on cities in sequence. We use a brute-force approach to check their work, permuting the cities and checking each permutation's length. As the number of cities fluctuates greatly between runs, they may be able to see the exponential nature of the solution's computing time (ie takes more tries to find the shortest path).
